<p></p>
<p>If you haven't watched Oblivion, don't touch this post. It will talk about the film, they call this a spoiler.♥️</p>
<p>Oblivion, the movie, allows for a few ways to see it. Most likely the fault of our eye, not so much the film.</p>
<p>1. The towering glass-enclosed house with a floating pool with a glass floor cannot have been designed to be "ugly". It seems to reflect a type of human dream.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-1.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>2. Did there need to be disgrace under this "dream home"? A "contaminated" environment, "inferior" beings living in misery hunted as rebels? It seems so.</p>
<p>Some message may be being passed.</p>
<p>3. The woman doesn't go out into the field. She stays at home - "safe". This reminds me of the concern for women's "uteruses" before the premiere of the first locomotive, which was going at a dazzling, for the time, 60km/h. The news is <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/67806/early-trains-were-thought-make-womens-uteruses-fly-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">real</a>, from the time. Machismo persists, still, in the film.</p>
<p>I'm still watching.</p>
<p>From what I remember,</p>
<p>4. Love saves everything. 5. They will live on the ground, with nature, with love.</p>
<p>In this sense, the house and the wife inside seem like an artificial relationship. Did the most "beautiful" house need to represent a bad relationship? Perhaps it needed to: compensate for the emptiness with a great work. Something along those lines.</p>
<p>It will be possible to go further.</p>
<p>The company - giant - deceives the "employees" always promising something a few weeks from then. Then it repeats the cycle. It perpetuates a "nothing": its own destruction and contamination, the same one, not without irony, that builds the dream home.</p>
<p>I'm publishing before I finish watching.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-2.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>6. The destroyed moon should not just be a supporting character. Long shot: if the moon represents love, love has been destroyed.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-3.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>7. After the dreamlike kiss under the pool, his muse, like a mermaid, goes down. It is love calling "down from the house: to the ground".</p>
<p>8. The insistence on "are you and Jack an effective team?" is not a supporting character. A corporate mantra, it seems to be. Perhaps the question is to hide the real objective behind so many effective tasks, not to question the effectiveness per se. But the effectiveness seems a little robotic. Per se.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at his paradise hideout on earth, with plants, crystal clear water, a friendly fish, a flannel shirt, Led Zeppelin on vinyl and a basketball court, the phrase:</p>
<p>9. "I'm going to miss this place". When the couple "finish the mission". This perhaps great message, will it be the greatest? I call it the paradox of total technology, something like that. When we really have nuclear fusion (our own sun, anywhere), master chemistry and biology, perhaps - I said perhaps - we will realize that we were only little friends of the planet while it "was bigger than us". While it was a "womb". If we don't need it - even if always with kindness and gratitude, even with longing - wouldn't we relegate it to the background like we do with piano and other old things? This confronts us with a very heavy question, which asks "if we really like nature?". Mosquito repellent is just a hint, the true answer, if it ever appears, is immense.</p>
<p>10. "It would have been great", right after "I'm going to miss this place", questions technology. Alchemy. In fact, we could take this question back to before agriculture, when we still quasi-mated because of how related we were to nature. "Before we bit the apple", experienced scientists note that the bitten apple would represent this split of man from life in nature (before surplus agriculture and current religions). "It would have been great" may also just represent fear of the new. Simple as that: real fear. A desire to return, before and instead of changing.</p>
<p>11. "Our job is not to remember..." "Remember?". This phrase interestingly shows that you should only remember what is of interest. Not the more distant past. Perhaps: the brainwashing that entrepreneurship can bring: remember our mission and values (forget the rest).</p>
<p>12. "I can't protect you", says the wife and co-worker when Jack goes down with his muse. The fear of breaking company rules, or a type of bureaucracy, with no room for improvisation. Interestingly, the button that disconnects and makes the mission "informal", "offline" is the only red button among all the white ones. In the Cold War, "bad" things were red (in American films, at least). Therefore "being online would be bad (red)". When turning off, the red light goes out. Informal with love, they go down.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-4.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>13. The fear of "what's down there" is sincere. The wife in the house genuinely shivers when Jack is "down there". Perhaps it would be like "good people" shivering at what happens in the streets of the periphery, in a Brazil. But I forced this analogy.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-5.jpg" alt="" /></figure>

<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-7.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>14. Love pierces brainwashing from large corporations. Jack remembers. Like neutrinos, like X-rays. Love pierces, unstoppable. It is the regurgitation of the bitten apple, I really dare to propose. Returning to communion with nature. Abandoning the corporation. Technology. Returning to the womb from a DNA point of view (but not so far to the bacterial broth, right? Until the wild age is fine).</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-8.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>Wow:</p>
<p>15. The technological wife - from the house - cries when she sees Jack with his love-muse. Through the lens of the ship that will (was going to?) save Jack. "Save". What is "saving" begins to solidify. "Wow", because it would be interesting to explain the crying of the technological wife, of the glass-enclosed house. What does she want? Intriguing to think.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-9.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>16. Fighting against ourselves is, really, the great fight. The us of the glass-enclosed house, an exemplary employee, the us of love - who rediscovers the truth, who through love penetrates like a neutrino in corporate technological brainwashing. You and you. "Regurgitate" the bite of the apple, in the context of this film. Rediscover, instead of being expelled, from paradise. Let go of technology. Effectiveness. Let go of the glass pool over the clouds. Stop treating those below as contagious mosquitoes. In fact, as if they weren't human (but they are!).</p>
<p>17. The wife from tower 52 (Jack was from tower 49) does not notice the difference between the Jacks. I'm going to force it: that's how we feel, a little, with automated treatments in email spams, by telephone, by message. They try to call us by name, but they hardly know our essence. Guilty? Nobody.</p>
<p>18. Jack invites the technological wife from the glass tower 52 down. She genuinely has a curiosity, but as in the best iso-9000 production, with guaranteed predictability, she rejects it and feels uncomfortable with the subject. "It's against the rules". Her brainwashing was with very strong bleach - or there was no love neutrino. She goes back to the room. "Safe".</p>
<p>Jack and his muse go to the lake house. Jack says that it's just a copy of the real Jack. The muse says that Jack had promised a lake house. To get fat and old together.</p>
<p>19. Love could also be considered a machine. Repeating machine: lake house, 70s vinyl, basketball, baseball. Who is more legitimate? Automation via love, automation via technology. I don't know!</p>
<p>20. Jack calms the machine. The human-hunting drone. "Oooouuu" - as one would do with a horse. And the drone, agitated by the crowd around it, calms down. Jack fixes and understands the technology in depth. He is a technical engineer. But he didn't understand underlying intentions. The people on the ground understand.</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-10.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>21. The picture of the girl (hair like the muse, therefore, the muse) dragging herself towards the house cannot just be a supporting character. "Return home". To paradise. Regurgitate the bitten apple. Get out of technology, whose villain, not by coincidence, is called "tet" (almost "tec").</p>
<figure><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vladimirbrasil/vladidevblog/main/images/oblivion-image-11.jpg" alt="" /></figure>
<p>22. The kiss before the kamikaze-but-saving mission. The kiss. Saliva, feeling. Non-tinder, non-whatsapp. Dirty, sweaty. Non-technological, without spotless glass. Does our "DNA" - itself, yes! - speak? Can it scream even without vocal cords? Does it sense its extinction? Its change via crispr-cas9. Its alteration. Video games, less and less sweat - even before messing with DNA. Cleanliness, distance. Nature turning into a zoo. Can our DNA understandably struggle? "I don't want to die", it would scream, perhaps in the form of arts, since it acts without vocal cords? Note that even if it's true - the DNA screams - it doesn't mean, at least not automatically, that it's correct. There is a greater chance that it is a selfish self-preservation, that is, without thinking about the "next DNA" to which it would yield its existence. I went far, just ignore it.</p>
<p>23. The recording of the original mission of the original Jack. The "tet" (tec!) machine used the true head of the mission at the time to create a cloned head. With the same "good morning", "what a wonderful day", "is everything alright?" "Dear". We try to "take to the future" our best selves in: spams, virtual attendants, automated messages. "How are you, [your name]?". "Is everything alright?".</p>

<p>23B. Tet (tec) is hu-men-gous. We are plush ants.</p>

<p>24. Tet (tec!) clones humans like one makes sausages with pigs. Side by side, on an industrial scale. What does it mean?</p>

<p>25. Tet, the technology, has the essence - the look - red. Again, the cold war giving a hint about the real moral of tet (tec).</p>
<p>"What Horace said was:How can a man die better /Than facing adversity /For the ashes of his ancestors /And for the temples of his gods".</p>
<p>26. If this isn't our DNA trying to communicate, who is it? A hollywood director?</p>
<p>"I created you Jack. I am your god",</p>
<p>Tet, the technology, responds. Jack doesn't even care.</p>
<p>Horace, at least in this film, speaks louder.</p>
<p>Jack calls Tet (tec) Sally. Sally is knowingly a technological modeling of the true Sally of the past. A video. Photoshopped to say other things, with the same face. Calling tet (tec) Sally, Jack doesn't hesitate to treat her like a spam, that is: throw a nuclear bomb into her heart.</p>
<p>"If we have souls, They are made of the love we share Undimmed by time Unbound by death". [It doesn't end with time or death]</p>
<p>"I'm Jack Harper And I'm Home".</p>
<p>Says Jack 52, not 49. Can one clone - a spam - replace another?</p>
<p>Son of tet (tec), let's say. Very-well-cloned, what changes?</p>
<p>The clone in paradise with the muse. Clone and muse. Love, ancestry.</p>
<p>I know nothing.</p>
